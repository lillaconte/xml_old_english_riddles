## Encoding the _Exeter Book Riddles_ : The Whims of the Skies in Old English poetry ☁️

## 🎲 The Exeter Book Riddles 

The Exeter Book is a tenth-century codex containing a rich anthology of Old English literature. Several of the Exeter Book poetic texts offer an insight into the Old English approach to the sky, with perspectives ranging from the physical to the spiritual.

The abundance of metaphorical language and the precision with which alliterative patterns are constructed in the _Exeter Book Riddles_ make them a very suitable object of study for this project.

## 🌐 Overview of the project 

This project aims to encode six Old English Exeter Book riddles associated to early English perceptions of the sky or related imagery (the sun, the moon, heaven). It aims to outline the poetic structure of these texts and highlight the alliteration patterns which characterise Old English poetry. The encoding uses TEI guidelines.
